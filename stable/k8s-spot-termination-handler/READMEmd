# Kubernetes AWS EC2 Spot Termination Handler

This chart installs the [k8s-spot-termination-handler](https://github.com/pusher/k8s-spot-termination-handler)

## Purpose

Spot instances on EC2 come with significant cost savings, but with the burden of instance being terminated if
the market price goes higher than the maximum price you have configured.

The termination handler watches the AWS Metadata API for termination requests and starts draining the node
so that it can be terminated safely.

## Installation
```
helm install \
  stable/k8s-spot-termination-handler
```

If your cluster has RBAC enabled, run this command:
```
helm install \
  --set rbac.create=true \
  stable/k8s-spot-termination-handler
```
